# Create a Verifiable Presentation

This tutorial offers step-by-step guidance on how to create a [Verifiable Presentation](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vp-request-spec/).

> ⚠️ **Before you begin...** Make sure you've correctly [configured the cheqd plugin's agent settings](../setup/) for Veramo CLI

## Background

A Verifiable Presentation is a way a credential holder can generate cryptographicall-verifiable proof that they are in posession of the identity keys (e.g., `did:key`) the credential was issued to.

This is important because [just the Verifiable Credential and its JWT proof](verify-jwt-credential.md), on its own, is susceptible to [_replay attacks_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay\_attack) where intercepted Verifiable Credentials could be played back.

The process of creating a _Verifiable Presentation_ is one way of addressing these security concerns.

## Instructions

### 1. Start generating Verifiable Presentation

Begin the process of creating a Verifiable Presentation using:

```bash
veramo presentation create
```

### 2. Choose holder/subject identity key to sign the presentation

Specify the subject identity key to be used for signing Verifiable Presentation, e.g., chosen holder `did:key`.

### 3. Specify the `Tag` for the Verifiable Presentation

Hit _Enter_ to accept the default at this step

### 4. Specify the number of verifiers

Select how many verifiers will need to be able to verify the presentation.

### 4. Specify presentation type

This can be the same as the Verifiable Credential, or a sub-section of it. Choose _Enter_ for default.

### 6. Specify the verifier ID

Select the DID of the verifier from the options presented. In a very simplistic scenario, the verifier could be the same as the issuer, e.g., a scenario where the holder returns a period of time to show they were issued a credential.

### 7. Select the credential(s) to be included in the presentation

You can select one or more Verifiable Credentials to bundle up into the Verifiable Presentation.

### 8. View and save the Verifiable Presentation

After these choices are made, the Verifiable Presentation will be displayed in JSON format along with JWT proof.

Save this output in the folder you have been using throughout, saving as `pres.txt`.

You will need to call on this to verify the presentation in the next step.

## Next steps

In a real-world usage scenario, the Verifiable Presentation output generated above would be electronically (e.g., as API messages) or non-electronically (e.g., encoded to a QR code) shared with the verifier/recipient.

Verifiers/recipients would then be able to [verify the Verifiable Presentation](verify-jwt-presentation.md) to check cryptographically the contents are untampered.

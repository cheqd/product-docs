# üçä ACA-Py

Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) serves as a foundational tool for developing Verifiable Credential (VC) ecosystems. It functions at the second and third layers of the [Trust Over IP framework](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/toip_050520_primer.pdf) and supports multiple credential formats and protocols. As part of the [Open Wallet Foundation](https://openwallet.foundation/), ACA-Py's capabilities can be expanded with runtime-loaded plug-ins. Explore a diverse range of plug-ins in the [ACA-Py Plugins repository](https://plugins.aca-py.org/latest/).

ACA-Py now includes support for the **Cheqd DID** method, facilitating integration with Cheqd's decentralized identity ecosystem. Developers can utilize Cheqd for DID creation, resolution, and operations like issuing and verifying AnonCreds credentials. This offers an easy transition from the decommissioned Sovrin network to a modern, scalable alternative without disrupting existing workflows. Cheqd is fully supported in ACA-Py for issuing Verifiable Credentials, creating Credential Schemas, and Credential Definitions.

AnonCreds using cheqd are facilitated using the [cheqd AnonCreds Object Method](https://docs.cheqd.io/product/advanced/anoncreds).

## **Universal Registrar Integration**

The Cheqd plugin now supports **dynamic DID registration** using the Universal Registrar. This eliminates the need for separate configurations for different DID methods‚Äîusers simply need to run the appropriate driver.

### **Key Benefits**

* **Unified DID Support**: Allows multiple DID method registrations (not just Cheqd) through a single interface.
* **Streamlined Setup**: Reduces configuration complexity by dynamically handling DID registrations.
* **Seamless Interoperability**: Integrates effortlessly with supported DID methods.

For further configuration and usage examples, refer to the [Universal Registrar GitHub repository](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar).

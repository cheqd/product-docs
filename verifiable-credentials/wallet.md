# 👜 Demo Wallet for identity

cheqd has designed a wallet to demonstrate and test its DeFi functionality as well as its identity tooling.

[CHEQ Wallet](https://wallet.cheqd.io) allows users to perform standard DeFi activities on Cosmos such as staking/delegating, voting on governance Proposals, and sending tokens. Crucially, the CHEQ wallet goes one step further than this, offering the ability to store and share [Verifiable Credentials](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/introduction-to-decentralised-identity/what-is-a-verifiable-credential-vc).

## 🔥 Features

* Access your CHEQ wallet account by connecting to the [Keplr browser extension](https://keplr.app)
* Send CHEQ tokens
* Delegate, undelegate and redelegate to validators
* Store and share digital identity credentials

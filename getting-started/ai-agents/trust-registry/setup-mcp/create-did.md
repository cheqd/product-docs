# Create AI Agent DID

> ⚠️ **Before you begin...**
>
> Make sure you have configured the [MCP Client as per the setup instructions](./#getting-started).

After the MCP server is running and Claude Desktop (or any MCP Client) is connected, you can ask the agent to create a DID just by typing:

> Hello agent, can you create a did on cheqd testnet?

{% hint style="success" %}
The agent may ask for human input to run the "create-did" MCP tool, please select "yes" or "allow".
{% endhint %}

# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of cheqd projects, we'd love to hear from you.

We take all security bugs seriously. If confirmed upon investigation, we will patch it within a reasonable amount of time and release a public security bulletin discussing the impact and credit the discoverer.

There are two ways to report a security bug:

* Email us at [security-github@cheqd.io](mailto:security-github@cheqd.io)
* Join [our D](http://cheqd.link/join-cheqd-slack)[iscord Channel](https://discord.com/invite/4VZszdE7HH) and post a message on the #security channel

# VDR Tools CLI with cheqd (deprecated)

This page describes how identity-domain transactions can be integrated in 3rd party applications such as [Evernym VDR Tools](https://gitlab.com/evernym/verity/vdr-tools).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: This cheqd SDK integration has now been **deprecated** and is **no longer actively maintained**.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Base write flow

1. **Build a request** _Example_: `build_create_did_request(id, verkey, alias)`
2. **Sign the request using DID key** _Example_: `indy_crypto_sign(did, verkey)`
3. **Build a transaction with the request from previous step** _Example_: `build_tx(pool_alias, pub_key, builded_request, account_number, account_sequence, max_gas, max_coin_amount, denom, timeout_height, memo)`
4. **Sign the transaction** _Example_: `cheqd_keys_sign(wallet_handle, key_alias, tx)`.
5. **Broadcast a signed transaction** _Example_: `broadcast_tx_commit(pool_alias, signed)`.

## DID transactions

### Create DID

#### Command

`build_create_did_request(id, verkey, alias)`

#### Request format

```bash
CreateDidRequest 
{
    "data": {
               "id": "GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
               "verkey": "~HmUWn928bnFT6Ephf65YXv",
               "alias": "DID for Alice"
             },
    "owner": "GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
    "signature": "49W5WP5jr7x1fZhtpAhHFbuUDqUYZ3AKht88gUjrz8TEJZr5MZUPjskpfBFdboLPZXKjbGjutoVascfKiMD5W7Ba",
    "metadata": {}
}
```

* `id` (base58-encoded string): Target DID as base58-encoded string for 16 or 32 byte DID value
* `verkey` (base58-encoded string, possibly starting with "~~"; optional): Target verification key. It can start with "~~", which means that it is an abbreviated `verkey` and should be 16 bytes long when decoded. Otherwise, it's a full `verkey` which should be 32 bytes long when decoded.
* `alias` (string; optional)

#### Response format

```bash
CreateDidResponse {
    "key": "did:GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd" 
}
```

* `key`(string): A unique key is used to store this DID in a state

#### Response validation

* `CreateDidRequest` must be signed by the DID from `id` field. It means that this DID must be an owner of this DID transaction.

### Update DID

#### Command

`build_update_did_request(id, verkey, alias)`

#### Request format

```bash
UpdateDidRequest 
{
    "data": {
               "id": "GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
               "verkey": "~HmUWn928bnFT6Ephf65YXv",
               "alias": "DID for Alice"
             },
    "owner": "GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
    "signature": "49W5WP5jr7x1fZhtpAhHFbuUDqUYZ3AKht88gUjrz8TEJZr5MZUPjskpfBFdboLPZXKjbGjutoVascfKiMD5W7Ba",
    "metadata": {}
}
```

* `id` (base58-encoded string): Target DID as base58-encoded string for 16 or 32 byte DID value.
* `verkey` (base58-encoded string, possibly starting with "~~"; optional): Target verification key. It can start with "~~", which means that it is an abbreviated `verkey` and should be 16 bytes long when decoded. Otherwise, it's a full `verkey` which should be 32 bytes long when decoded.
* `alias` (string; optional).

#### Response format

```bash
UpdateDidResponse {
    "key": "did:GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd" 
}
```

* `key`(string): A unique key is used to store this DID in a state

#### Response validation

* A transaction with `id` from `UpdateDidRequest`must already be in a ledger created by `CreateDidRequest`
* `UpdateDidRequest` must be signed by the DID from `id` field. It means that this DID must be an owner of this DID transaction.

### Get DID

#### Command

`build_query_get_did(id)`

* `id` (base58-encoded string): Target DID as base58-encoded string for 16 or 32 byte DID value.

#### Request format

```bash
Request 
{
    "path": "/store/cheqd/key",
    "data": <bytes>,
    "height": 642,
    "prove": true
}
```

* `path`: Path for RPC endpoint for cheqd pool
* `data`: Query with an entity key from a state. String `did:<id>` encoded to bytes
* `height`: Ledger height (size). `None` for auto calculation
* `prove`: Boolean value. `True` for getting state proof in a pool response

#### Response format

```bash
QueryGetDidResponse{
        "did": {
               "id": "GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
               "verkey": "~HmUWn928bnFT6Ephf65YXv",
               "alias": "DID for Alice"
             },
}
```

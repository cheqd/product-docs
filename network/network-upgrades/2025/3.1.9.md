# 3.1.9

Version 3.1.9 brought our fee abstraction module into production, allowing users to carry out general and identity transactions using other IBC-enabled currencies, such as USDC. Read more below:

## :new\_moon: **Fee Abstraction (From Beta to Production)**

* Update the fee abstraction module to enable on-the-fly conversions between $CHEQ and any IBC-enabled asset for use in both identity and general transactions.
* This will enable cheqd's identity functionality, such as DIDs and DID-Linked Resources to be written using MiCA regulated assets such as USDC or EURe.
* After testing a beta version, this takes the feature to being production-ready.
* $CHEQ maintains its full utility being used as the host token, facilitating fee abstraction in the background.

## ðŸŒŸ **What This Means for You**

1. **More identity adoption:** With support for a wider array of currencies on the network, including MiCA regulated stablecoins, we are expecting adoption from a broader set of enterprise customers - meaning more DIDs, DLRs and burns.

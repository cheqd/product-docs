# ⬆️ Network Upgrades

## Context

Throughout 2022 we released a breaking upgrade roughly once every quarter. Throughout 2023 we continued with this frequency, however releasing non-breaking point releases consistently. In 2024, 2025 and beyond, we intend to release one major network upgrade per quarter.

## Release Timelines

To ensure we upgrade all nodes on the network in the most efficient way whilst maintaining due care to the upgrade process, we run the process in the following steps:

* Testnet proposal
* Testnet upgrade
* Mainnet Upgrade Proposal
* Mainnet On Chain Upgrade

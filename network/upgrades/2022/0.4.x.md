Our [packaged releases](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases) are currently compiled and tested for `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`, which is the recommended operating system for installation using Debian package or binaries.

## [v0.4.0](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/v0.4.0): Stability improvements after mainnet launch \[January 2022]

This software upgrade proposal upgraded the version of cheqd-node software on our mainnet from v0.3.1, to v0.4.x.

Following the successful release of our mainnet in November 2021, we wanted to fast-follow with a some immediate improvements we felt necessary for the cheqd network.

This new node version is intended to enhance functionality currently available on v0.3.1. The upgrade to v0.4.x will be a breaking change that introduces new routes, plus fixes a few technical debt issues identified in the v0.3.x branch.

### Changelog

* Bumped Cosmos SDK version from v0.44.3 to v0.44.5
* Update DID operations in version v0.3.1 did not carry out a check on the keys used to authenticate the transaction.
  * In essence, this meant that any update DID operation could incorrectly update a DID or its associated DIDDoc. This has now been fixed.
* Switched build system from using Starport to using Makefiles.
  * This gives greater control for future improvements and optimisation in adding support for other operating systems, database backends etc.
* The node software binary has now been compiled with support for Ledger hardware wallet devices for key storage.
* REST/gRPC endpoints for querying DIDs have been added. Documentation will be added to explain how these endpoints work.

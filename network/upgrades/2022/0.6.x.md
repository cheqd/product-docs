# 0.6.x

This list contains all **stable** releases in the [cheqd-node](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/) **v0.6.x** family, and skips **pre-release** versions.

## [v0.6.10](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/v0.6.10): Genesis export fixes \[December 2022]

## [v0.6.9](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/v0.6.9): "Dragonberry" security vulnerability patch \[October 2022]

The following steps have been prepared by the cheqd development team for cheqd validators to follow in order to manually upgrade their node.

This is in response to [a high-risk security vulnerability (dubbed "Dragonberry")](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/ibc-security-advisory-dragonberry/7702) related to IBC protocol / ICS23.

This is [closely related to the "Dragonfruit" security vulnerability published on Cosmos forums](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cosmos-sdk-security-advisory-dragonfruit/7614). v0.6.9 fixes this vulnerability by patching to [Cosmos SDK v0.45.9](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.9) upstream.

### Considerations

This patch is non-state-breaking. This means that validators can switch to the new binary, and restart their node without necessarily needing an on-chain software upgrade (which is intended for consensus-breaking changes).

The patch has already been applied to [cheqd's own validator node](https://explorer.cheqd.io/validators/cheqdvaloper1lg0vwuu888hu4arnt9egtqrm2662kcrtf2unrs) and one of the other large validators (at the time of writing this).

## [v0.6.7](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/v0.6.7): Multi-platform builds \[August 2022]

## [v0.6.1](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/v0.6.1): Installer and Docker fixes \[August 2022]

## [v0.6.0](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/v0.6.0): DID-Linked Resources & Tooling for an Improved Developer Experience \[July 2022]

Here’s what’s new in the latest cheqd node version - v0.6.0. This release is a state-breaking update that brings fundamental changes to the cheqd-node testnet and mainnet. The release notes below pertain to the cheqd-node changes only.

### Summary

This upgrade includes 3 primary enhancements and new features, each of which helping accelerate cheqd to support a greater number of credential formats & SDKs, more use cases for decentralised identity applications and streamline the end-to-end developer experience.

1. Implementation of a Resources module, used to support DID-Linked Resources
2. Introduction of an Interactive Installer to streamline the developer onboarding experience
3. Introduction of Cosmovisor for automated upgrades.

### Feature Deep-dive

#### 1. Implementation of a Resources module, used to support DID-Linked Resources

**What's changed?**

The concept of resources in self-sovereign identity (SSI) ecosystems is not new, however, as we will discuss throughout this blog post, existing approaches to resources in SSI oblige adopters to make compromises between security, availability and interoperability. We first noticed this when we were looking at how we could securely reference credential schemas, something we will expand on throughout this post.

Our objective in building resources on cheqd is to improve the way resources are stored, referenced and retrieved for our partners and the broader SSI community, in line with the existing [W3C DID Core standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

An initial use case for DID-Linked Resources is supporting AnonCreds on cheqd. This is an industry first as AnonCreds have to date been tightly bedded to the Indy ledger. We are using the Resources module to create DID-Linked Resources for schemas and CredDef, bringing AnonCreds support to the cheqd ledger in a W3C compliant format.

Please take a [look at our blog](https://blog.cheqd.io/our-approach-to-resources-on-ledger-25bf5690c975) which provides a thorough explanation for your reasoning on this approach, and links to our documentation.

#### 2. Introduction of an Interactive Installer to streamline the developer onboarding experience

**What's changed?**

Prior to this upgrade, we offered developers looking to setup using a Ubuntu `.deb` package file and installing a [with Docker](https://docs.cheqd.io/node/getting-started/setup-and-configure/docker)

Although these were fit for purpose, allowing the vast majority of validators on the cheqd network to get set up these methods do require a higher level of technical skillset, and are more time-consuming.

The Interactive Installer offers a more intuitive and simple developer experience, which guides developers through a step-by-step journey, asking questions with the CLI along the way.

Find out more about how to get started using the [Interactive Installer here](https://docs.cheqd.io/node/getting-started/setup-and-configure).

#### 3. Introduction of Cosmovisor for automated upgrades

**What's changed?**

With an increasing number of validators on the cheqd network, we wanted to provide developers managing nodes the opportunity to more easily upgrade their node.

[Cosmovisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/tooling/cosmovisor) is a small process manager for Cosmos SDK application binaries that monitors the governance module for incoming chain upgrade proposals. If it sees a proposal that gets approved, cosmovisor can automatically download the new binary, stop the current binary, switch from the old binary to the new one, and finally restart the node with the new binary.

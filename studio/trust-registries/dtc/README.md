# Decentralized Trust Chains (DTCs)

## Introduction[‚Äã](https://hub.ebsi.eu/vc-framework/trust-model/issuer-trust-model-v3#introduction) <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are most commonly issued by legal entities to assert facts such as identity, qualifications, or authorisation. Their core purpose is to provide the **Relying Party** ‚Äî the entity verifying the credential ‚Äî with a **Level of Assurance (LoA)** that the claims within the credential are legitimate.

However, in practice, it‚Äôs often difficult for relying parties to determine whether a legal entity issuing a credential is **authentic**, or a **fraudulent impersonation**. There is no built-in mechanism in most credential ecosystems for verifying whether a DID-based issuer is recognised, authorised, or trustworthy.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: This lack of trusted issuer infrastructure is a critical blocker for many digital credential ecosystems ‚Äî and a common reason why solutions stall before reaching production.
{% endhint %}

To fully establish trust, relying parties must be able to:

* Identify **who issued** a credential
* Understand **whether the issuer was authorised** to issue it
* Trace **who accredited the issuer**, and under what governance framework

### Introducing Decentralized Trust Chains (DTCs)

To solve this challenge, **cheqd** introduces a v**erifiable trust infrastructure** called **Decentralized Trust Chains (DTCs)** ‚Äî a model that complements and extends approaches like the **EBSI Trust Chain Framework**.

DTCs allow participants to create **hierarchical chains of trust**, where:

* A **Root Trusted Accreditation Organisation (rTAO)** defines the governance model
* **Verifiable Accreditations** delegate authority to other legal entities (e.g., TAOs, Trusted Issuers)
* **Verifiable Credentials** are issued by accredited issuers, with embedded metadata that references the trust chain

Together, these components form a **decentralized trust registry** for each ecosystem.

### Publicly Verifiable, Policy-Governed Trust

cheqd‚Äôs DTC model introduces both **permissions** and **policies**:

* **Permissions** define what an entity is allowed to do (e.g. issue or accredit)
* **Policies** define **who granted that permission**, under what framework, and with what legal or operational requirements.

This infrastructure is made **publicly resolvable** by publishing all authorisations and accreditations as **DID-Linked Resources** on the cheqd ledger. This means:

* üß© Trust relationships are **machine-verifiable**
* üîç Verifiers do not need prior knowledge of each entity
* üõ†Ô∏è Resolution follows W3C standards like **DID-Core, DID Resolution and DID-Linked Resources.**

The result: A scalable, cryptographically verifiable way to determine whether an issuer ‚Äî and the credential they issue ‚Äî can be trusted.

## Establishing a Trust Hierarchy <a href="#hierarchy-examples" id="hierarchy-examples"></a>

Decentralized Trust Chains are based on the concept of a **hierarchical trust model**, conceptually similar to traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). At the top sits a **Root of Trust**, from which trust is delegated through a verifiable chain of credentials.

In this model, each participant is identified by a **Decentralized Identifier (DID)** and may be granted permission ‚Äî via a Verifiable Accreditation ‚Äî to accredit others or issue credentials themselves.

### How the Hierarchy Works

Trust is delegated top-down through **Verifiable Accreditations**:

| Role                                         | Description                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Root TAO (rTAO)**                          | Issues Root Authorisations and initial Accreditations to other TAOs. Sets the governance baseline.       |
| **Trusted Accreditation Organisation (TAO)** | Can accredit other TAOs or Trusted Issuers. Acts as an intermediary layer in larger ecosystems.          |
| **Trusted Issuer (TI)**                      | Issues **Verifiable Credentials** to users/entities, based on permissions received from an upstream TAO. |

The following diagram show how a Root TAO accredits two TAOs lower in the hierarchy:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/cheqd_root_of_trust_1.png" alt="Diagram showing hierarchical Decentralized Trust Chain architecture"><figcaption><p>Hierarchical Decentralized Trust Chain architecture on cheqd</p></figcaption></figure>

Each role is cryptographically linked through issued Verifiable Credentials, creating a **machine-verifiable trust path**.

### Verifiable Credentials & Policy Enforcement

* **Credentials** are issued with a `termsOfUse` section that references an **Attestation Policy**, linking them back to the issuer‚Äôs accreditation and the root of trust.
* **Digital Wallets** or agents can present these credentials for verification.
* **Verifiers** can then resolve and validate the entire trust chain ‚Äî from the issuer to the rTAO ‚Äî using DID resolution and optional DNS anchoring.

## Trust Infrastructure Roles and their Permissions <a href="#trust-model-roles-and-their-permissions" id="trust-model-roles-and-their-permissions"></a>

As shown in the diagram above, legal entities can play the following roles:

*   In a Decentralized Trust Chain, each legal entity assumes a defined role with clearly scoped permissions. While a single DID may represent multiple roles in simple ecosystems, every complete trust chain should include these three functional roles:

    * **Root Trusted Accreditation Organisation (rTAO)**
    * **Trusted Accreditation Organisation (TAO)**
    * **Trusted Issuer (TI)**

    Only the **Trusted Issuer (TI)** is permitted to issue domain-specific Verifiable Credentials (VCs).

### **Root Trusted Accreditation Organisation (rTAO)**

The **rTAO** is the root of governance in a trust chain. It establishes the ecosystem‚Äôs rules and authorises who can issue or accredit within it.

**Capabilities:**

* Issue a **Root Authorisation** that defines the Trust Framework
* Self-accredit for governance or issuance
* Accredit TAOs and TIs to delegate responsibility
* Revoke accreditations from any participant in the trust chain

**Credential Type:**

* `VerifiableAuthorisationForTrustChain`

**Policy Type:**

* `TrustFrameworkPolicy` (included in `termsOfUse`)

### **Trusted Accreditation Organisation (TAO)**[**‚Äã**](https://hub.ebsi.eu/vc-framework/trust-model/issuer-trust-model-v4#trusted-accreditation-organisation-tao)

A **TAO** manages a delegated segment of the trust chain under the rTAO. It may further accredit entities or take on the role of issuer if permitted.

**Capabilities:**

* Accredit itself to issue VCs
* Accredit other TAOs or Trusted Issuers
* Revoke accreditations issued within its scope

**Credential Type:**

* `VerifiableAccreditationToAccredit`

**Policy Type:**

* `AccreditationPolicy` (included in `termsOfUse`)

### **Trusted Issuer (TI)**[**‚Äã**](https://hub.ebsi.eu/vc-framework/trust-model/issuer-trust-model-v4#trusted-issuer-ti)

A **Trusted Issuer** is an entity that issues domain-specific Verifiable Credentials under the conditions granted by its accreditation.

**Capabilities:**

* Issue Verifiable Credentials to users or organisations
* Only within the types, schemas, and jurisdictions defined in their accreditation

**Credential Type:**

* `VerifiableAccreditationToAttest`

**Policy Type:**

* `AccreditationPolicy` (accreditation) +\
  `AttestationPolicy` (included in the issued credential‚Äôs `termsOfUse`)

## Policies Overview[‚Äã](https://hub.ebsi.eu/vc-framework/trust-model/issuer-trust-model-v4#policies-overview) <a href="#policies-overview" id="policies-overview"></a>

Policies define the **rules, permissions, and governance bindings** for each layer of the trust chain. They are embedded into credentials via the `termsOfUse` field and fall into three types:

| Policy Type              | Used In                  | Purpose                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TrustFrameworkPolicy** | Root Authorisation       | Defines the root governance model                                           |
| **AccreditationPolicy**  | Verifiable Accreditation | Constrains and describes the scope of authority                             |
| **AttestationPolicy**    | Verifiable Credential    | Links the credential back to the issuer‚Äôs accreditation and trust framework |

### How Policies are Linked

* **Root Authorisation** includes a `TrustFrameworkPolicy`
* **Each Accreditation** must reference:
  * A parent `AccreditationPolicy`, or
  * The original `TrustFrameworkPolicy`
* **Each Credential (Attestation)** must reference:
  * The `AttestationPolicy` pointing back to the issuer‚Äôs accreditation

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Diagram showing different policy relationships in the trust chain</p></figcaption></figure>

This layered policy model enables verifiers to **traverse and validate the entire trust chain** ‚Äî from a single credential back to a rTAO (optionally anchored in DNS) ‚Äî while ensuring that all participants adhere to consistent governance and operational standards.

## Trust Types in Decentralized Trust Chains

Trust Chains are constructed from three verifiable building blocks:

### 1. **Authorisations**

* Define the rules of the ecosystem
* Issued by the rTAO as a `VerifiableAuthorisationForTrustChain`
* Reference the root governance framework

### 2. **Accreditations**

* Grant permission to accredit or issue
* Are always domain-specific and non-transferable
* Must include an `AccreditationPolicy` in `termsOfUse`
* Allow entities to govern or issue **only** within the authorised scope

### 3. **Credentials (Attestations)**

* Assert facts (identity, qualifications, rights)
* Must include an `AttestationPolicy` that:
  * Links back to the issuer's accreditation
  * Establishes a trust path to the root authority
* Issuable only by **accredited Trusted Issuers**

#### In Summary:

| **Element**                    | **Purpose**                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authorisations**             | Define the governance and policy rules at the root of the trust chain  |
| **Accreditations**             | Delegate trust authority for accreditation or credential issuance      |
| **Credentials (Attestations)** | Assert verifiable facts within the scope of a governed trust framework |

## Get Started

## Get started

Use **cheqd Studio APIs** to define, issue, and publish trust registry entries:

* Create and manage **Root Authorisations**, **Accreditations**, and **Attestations**
* Resolve trust chains in real time using standard DID resolution
* Anchor trust registries on-chain while keeping business logic off-chain

For verification, use TRAIN to validate the trust registry to determine whether an issuer DID is accredited, and what they are accredited for ‚Äî by traversing the full trust chain to its root.&#x20;
